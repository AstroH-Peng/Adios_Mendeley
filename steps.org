* Steps
  - [ ] Fix the entries with broken links to PDFs
    - use list of changes in 20/06 from seafile
  - [ ] Generate bibtex from mendeley
  - [ ] Import it into JabRef to check duplicated keys or use sed and uniq.
  - [ ] Fix those in Mendeley
  - [ ] Export bibtex from Mendeley again
  - [ ] Rename all pdfs and other files with long names
    - find long file names (not dir names, as those will be fixed by
      Zotero later)
    - Rename appropriately
    - Change entry in the bibtex file
  - [ ] Add the tags, notes, data added, and folder fields to bibtex
    - ??
  - [ ] Create a JabRef like group structure from the folder fields
    


** Why not do all manipulating the sqlite?
   - Bcause the bibtex route I understand better, and Mendeley generates
     more or less OK bibtex.
